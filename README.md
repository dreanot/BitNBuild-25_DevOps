📌 Project Abstract:

In India, filing taxes and managing personal finances is often complex and time-consuming. Individuals rely on spreadsheets, fragmented services, or costly tax consultants. TaxWise is an AI-powered personal finance platform that simplifies:

Tax filing → auto-categorizes income/expenses, applies deductions, simulates Old vs New regimes.

Credit health → analyzes credit behavior and provides actionable tips to improve CIBIL score.

Unified insights → dashboard with spending breakdown, projected liabilities, and personalized recommendations.

Our goal is to empower users to maximize legal tax savings, maintain strong creditworthiness, and make smarter financial decisions — all with minimal effort.
